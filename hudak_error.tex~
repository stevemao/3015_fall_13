\maketitle

In Hudak's text {\em{The Haskell Scholl of Expression: Learning
Functional Programming through Multimedia}} the following property is
claimed to hold for all infinite lists.

\[take\, n\, xs \append{}drop\, n\, xs\,  = xs\]

The definitions of take a drop are given as follows.


\[\begin{array}{rcl}
 take & & :: Int $\rightarrow$ [a] $\rightarrow$ [a] \\
 take 0 \_ & = &  \nil \\
 take \_ \nil & = &  \nil \\
 take\, n\, \nil\, |\, n > 0 & = &  x:take (n-1) xs \\
\end{program*}

Recall the list induction principle to prove a property for finite lists of type $a$.

\[\begin{array}{l}

[P([\,]) \wedge \\
\;\;\forall{}x::a.\,\forall xs::[a].\, P(xs) \Rightarrow P(x:xs) \\
\;\;\; \Rightarrow \forall{}ys::[a]. P(ys)
\end{array}\]

Thus, for a property $P$ of lists, to show that $\forall{}ys::[a].\; P(ys)$ it
is enough to show two things:
\[\begin{array}{rl}
{\bf{i.)}} & P([\,]) \\
{\bf{ii.)}} & \forall x::a.\,\forall{}xs::[a].\, P(xs) \Rightarrow P(x:xs)\\
\end{array}\]

Here are some definitions (note that $\bot$ means loop forever).
\[\begin{array}{l}

head (x:xs) = x \\
head [\,] = \bot \\
\ \\
last [x] = x \\
last (x:xs) = last \; xs \\
last [\,] = \bot \\
\ \\
reverse [\,] = [\,]\\
reverse (x:xs) = (reverse \; xs ) ++ [x] \\
\ \\
map\; f\, [\,] = [\,] \\
map \; f \; (x:xs) = (f\; x)\, :\, map \; f \; xs \\
\ \\
(f\, .\, g)\; x = f\, (g\; x)\\

\end{array}\]


Two useful lemmas for problem 3 and 4 are as follows:
\[\begin{array}{ll}
Lemma\; 1. & \forall ys,xs ::[a].\; xs \not= [] \Rightarrow last (ys ++ xs) = last \; xs\\
Lemma\; 2. & \forall ys,xs ::[a].\; xs \not= [] \Rightarrow head (xs ++ ys) = head \; xs\\
\end{array}\]

One proof technique you also might need for 3 or 4 is case analysis.  For any
list $xs :: [a]$ you can say $xs = []$ or $xs = y:ys$ for some arbitrary $y:a$
and $ys :: [a]$.  This can be captured in a lemma as follws:

\[\begin{array}{ll}
Lemma \;3. & \forall xs ::[a].\; xs= []  \vee \exists y:: a, ys::[a].\; xs = (y:ys)\\
\end{array}\]

Prove the following by finite list induction \footnote{For problem 2 you can assume
$g::a\rightarrow{}b$ and $f::b\rightarrow{}c$.}.

\[\begin{array}{ll}
1.) & \forall{}xs \!::\![a].\; map \,(\backslash x \rightarrow x)\; xs = xs \\
2.) & \forall{}xs \!::\![a].\; map \,(f\, .\; g)\, xs = ((map\; f)\, .\, (map\; g))\; xs\\
3.) & \forall{}xs \!::\![a].\; head\, (reverse \; xs) = last \; xs \\
4.) & \forall{}xs \!::\![a].\; last\, (reverse \; xs) = head \; xs
\end{array}
\]

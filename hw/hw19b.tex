\exercise{Read chapter 11 of Bird.}

\exercise{Write a parser for a very simple form of arithmetic expression; a
single digit followed by a '+' followed by another digit {\em{e.g.}} expression
in this language have the form: ``d+d''.  Your parser should {\em{return}} the
result of adding the digits together.  Give some tests that show what your
parser does when the string is not of the proper form and what it does when it
is.}

Here is the code given by Hudak in his lecture slides for implementing the Unix wordcount (wc) command.

\begin{program*}

\> wcf :: (Int,Int,Int) -> String -> (Int,Int,Int)      \\
\> wcf (cc,w,lc) []          = (cc,w,lc)      \\
\> wcf (cc,w,lc) (' '  : xs) = wcf (cc+1,w+1,lc) xs      \\
\> wcf (cc,w,lc) ('$\backslash$t' : xs) = wcf (cc+1,w+1,lc) xs      \\
\> wcf (cc,w,lc) ('$\backslash$n' : xs) = wcf (cc+1,w+1,lc+1) xs      \\
\> wcf (cc,w,lc) (x : xs)    = wcf (cc+1,w,lc) xs      \\
\>       \\
\> wc :: IO ()      \\
\> wc = do name     <- getLine      \\
\>         contents <- readFile name      \\
\>         let (cc,w,lc) = wcf (0,0,0) contents      \\
\>         putStrLn (¡ÈThe file: ¡È ++ name ++ ¡Èhas ¡È)      \\
\>         putStrLn (show cc ++ ¡È characters ¡È)      \\
\>         putStrLn (show w  ++ ¡È words ¡È)      \\
\>         putStrLn (show lc ++ ¡È lines ¡È)      \\

\end{program*}


Not that in this implementation, a file containing only two spaces (or a space
and a tab, or a tab and a space or two tabs) will be counted as having two
words. This is a bug.  Redesign the code so that whitespace is grouped and,
while individual spaces are counted as characters, they only are counted as
delimiting words if they separate non-word or line delimiting characters.

Provide test cases for you code to show that it does the ``right thing.''  What
about a file containing a single space character, or a space followed by a
newline?

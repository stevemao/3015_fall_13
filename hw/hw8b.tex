Recall the function {\tt{last}} which was defined by recursion on the structure of the list.

\begin{program*}
\> last [] = error "last: nil." \\
\> last (x:xs) = if null xs then x else last xs\\
\end{program*}

You need to implement the following functions by recursion on the structure of
at least one of the list arguments:

\begin{problem}
{\tt{ismem :: (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Bool}} 
\begin{quotation}A call to the function {\tt{ismem}} of
the form {\tt{(ismem x ys)}} returns {\tt{True}} if {\tt{x}} is in the list
{\tt{ys}} and returns {\tt{False}} otherwise.
\end{quotation}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
{\tt{allaremem :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [a] -> Bool}}
\begin{quotation}
  A call to {\tt{allaremem}} of the form {\tt{(allaremem xs ys)}} returns
  {\tt{True}} if all the elements in the list {\tt{xs}} occur in the list
  {\tt{ys}} and returns {\tt{False}} otherwise. In analogy with subsets, you
  might think of this as a sublist function, it returns true if the first list
  is a sublist of the second (disregarding order.) You may find your
  implementation of {\tt{ismem}} useful in defining {\tt{allaremem}}.
\end{quotation}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
{\tt{find :: (Eq a) => a -> [(a, b)] -> b}}
\begin{quotation}
 A call of the form {\tt{(find x xys)}} returns {\tt{y}} (where {\tt{y}} has
  type {\tt{b}}) if there is a pair of the form {\tt{(x,y)}} in the list {\tt{xys}}
  and raises an exception otherwise.
Here's a big hint on {\tt{find}}, the left side of the definition of
find could appear as follows:

\begin{program*}
\> find x [] =  ... \\
\> find x ((y,z): yzs) = ...
\end{program*}
 Setting up the left side of the definition like this allows for pattern
matching on the structure of the pairs in the list argument.  
\end{quotation}
\end{problem}

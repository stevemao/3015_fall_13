\section{Trees,  maps, and folds}


In class we built some code for a tree type:

\begin{verbatim}
module MyTree where

data Tree a = Leaf | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving Show

-- mktree turns a list into a realtively balanced tree
mktree :: [a] -> Tree a
mktree [] = Leaf
mktree (x:xs) = Node x (mktree left) (mktree right)
  where (left,right) = splitAt (length xs `div` 2) xs

-- flatten turns a tree into a list (inverse of mktree)
flatten :: Tree a -> [a]
flatten Leaf = []
flatten (Node x left right) = x : (flatten left ++ flatten right)

-- mapT maps a function over a tree
mapT :: (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b
mapT f Leaf = Leaf
mapT f (Node x left right) = Node (f x) (mapT f left) (mapT f right)

-- foldT collapses a tree
foldT :: ( a -> b -> b -> b) -> b -> Tree a -> b
foldT f id Leaf = id
foldT f id (Node x left right) = f x (foldT f id left) (foldT f id right)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{exercise}
Implement {\tt{mapT}} using {\tt{foldT}}. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Can you implement {\tt{foldT}} using {\tt{mapT}} - why or why not?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Here's a  type of trees that can have none, one or two childen.  
\begin{verbatim}
data OneTwoTree a = 
   Leaf | 
   Node1 a (OneTwoTree a) | 
   Node2 a (OneTwoTree a) (OneTwoTree a) deriving Show
\end{verbatim}
Create a module called {\tt{OneTwoTree}} and add code to implement map and fold
functions for this new type.  Note that since there are three constructors for the type {\tt{OneTwoTree}} there will be three arguments to the fold.  I called my versions {\tt{mapOTT}} and {\tt{foldOTT}} and they have the following types:

\begin{verbatim}
mapOTT :: (a -> b) -> OneTwoTree a -> OneTwoTree b
foldOTT :: b -> (a -> b -> b) -> (a -> b -> b -> b) -> OneTwoTree a -> b
\end{verbatim}

As always - run some tests on your code to convince the grader that your code works.

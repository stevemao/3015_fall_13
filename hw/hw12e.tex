\homework{12}{30 October}

Here is some code for a calculator language similar to the one presented by
Hadi in class Tuesday extended to include additional constructors - a {\tt{Let}} statement,
{\tt{if-then-else}}, {\tt{FF}}, {\tt{Not}}, {\tt{And}}, and {\tt{Or}}.  


In the evaluator\footnote{This is like C, C++ and Ruby, 0 is interpreted as
false and {\em{any}} non-zero value is interpreted as true.}, rather than
include Boolean values, you will interpret false {\tt{FF}} as 0 and and any
non-zero value as true.  So, in the context of the Boolean slot in an
{\tt{if-then-else}} expression, something like {\tt{Const 19}} is interpreted as
true and {\tt{Const 0}} is interpreted as false.  


\begin{program*}
\>   \\
\> data BinOp = Plus | Minus | Times | Div | And | Or  deriving Show  \\
\>   \\
\> meaning Plus = (+)  \\
\> meaning Minus x y =  x - y  \\
\> meaning Times = (*)  \\
\> meaning Div = div  \\
\> meaning And = 0 -- <- your code here (remember an Int is false if it is (==0) and true otherwise)  \\
\> meaning Or = 0 -- <- your code here  \\
\>   \\
\> data Exp = \\
\>     | Const Int   \\
\>     | Var String   \\
\>     | BinExp BinOp Exp Exp   \\
\>     | Let String Exp Exp   \\
\>     | If Exp Exp Exp   \\
\>     | FF   \\
\>     | Not Exp   \\ 
\>       deriving Show   \\ 
\>   \\
\> type Assignment = (String -> Int)  \\
\> update :: (String,Int) -> Assignment -> Assignment  \\
\> update (x,v) f = (y -> if x == y then v else f y)  \\
\>   \\
\> a0 :: Assignment  \\
\> a0 x = error ("undefined variable " ++ x)  \\
\>   \\
\> eval :: Assignment -> Exp  -> Int  \\
\> eval a (Const k) = k  \\
\> eval a (Var s) = a s  \\
\> eval a (BinExp op e1 e2) = (meaning op) (eval a e1) (eval  a e2)  \\
\> eval a (Let x e1 e2) = 0 -- <- your code here  \\
\> eval a (If b e1 e2) = 0 -- <- your code here   \\
\> eval a FF = 0 -- <- your code here  \\
\> eval a (Not e) = 0 -- <- your code here  \\
\end{program*}

For a {\tt{Let}} expression of the form {\tt{Let x e1 e2}} evaluate {\tt{e1}}
in using the current assignment - call the resulting value {\tt{v}}. Now, make
a new assignment in which the string {\tt{x}} gets bound to {\tt{v}} and use
that assignment to evaluate {\tt{e2}}.

\exercise{You need to fill in the missing code.}

\exercise{You can check your code ont he test cases included - but ALSO write some test cases of your own.  The extensiveness of your test code
will count toward the credit on this homework.  (Stuff like having
a {\tt{Let}}-expression as the Boolean in an {\tt{If-then-else}} construct is
the kind of creative and interesting test cases we hope to see.)}

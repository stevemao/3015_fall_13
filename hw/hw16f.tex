Read about file IO in LYAHFGG.
Recall the primitive file IO commands as discussed in LYAHFGG.

\begin{program*}
\> writeFile :: FilePath -> String -> IO () \\
\> appendFile :: FilePath -> String -> IO () \\
\> readFile :: FilePath -> IO String \\
\end{program*}


\exercise{Write and compile a program {\tt{cp.hs}} that expects two arguments which are file names and  copies the first to the second.  What will you do if the second file already exists?

}

\exercise{Write and compile a program {\tt{grep.hs}} that, given a string (say
  {\tt{s}}) and a filename (say {\tt{fn}}), prints to the screen (think
  {\tt{putStr}}) all lines of the file that contain the string {\tt{s}} as a
  substring\footnote{Note that the real {\tt{grep}} command takes a regular expression as an argument - you program need only take a fixed string.}.

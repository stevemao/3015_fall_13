\section{Convex Polygons}

\exercise{} Carefully read chapters 8 - 10 of the text.

\exercise{} Do exercise 8.11 from page 104 of the book.

{\em{Note:}} To test for convexity, pick each edge in turn, and see if all the
other vertices are on the same side of that edge. You'll know how to do this if
you read the book. If that is so for all the edges, the polygon is convex. If
not, it is concave (and one of the vertices on any such edge is at an angle
larger than 180 degrees).

\section{ Highlights of the 9/8/11 Lecture}

\subsection{Prefix operators, Infix operators and Sections}

If $f$ is a function of type $a\rightarrow{}b\rightarrow{}c$ we reminded the
class that it can be used in an infix position by enclosing it in back-quotes
(`).  Thus, $f\; x\; y\;\;\ = \;\; x\; `f`\; y$.\\

If $\otimes$ is an infix binary operator symbol, then enclosing that symbol in
parenthesis transforms it into a Curried operator. You can also add an argument
to the left or right side to create a unary function.  Thus, if $(\otimes) ::
a\rightarrow{} b \rightarrow{}c$, $x::a$ and $y::b\;$ then $\;(x\,\otimes)$ has type $b\rightarrow{}c\;\;$ and $\;(\otimes{}y)$ has type $a\rightarrow{}c$.


For example, consider the the infix cons operator $(:) ::
a\rightarrow{}[a]\rightarrow[a]$.  Then $(42 :)$ has type $(Num\,a)\Rightarrow
[a] \rightarrow [a]$ and $(:[2,3])$ has type $(Num\,a)\Rightarrow a \rightarrow
[a]$.  Recall that $flip$ has type $ (a \rightarrow{} b \rightarrow{} c)
\rightarrow{} b \rightarrow{} a \rightarrow{} c$, thus $\;(flip \,(:)) :: [a]
\rightarrow{}a\rightarrow{}[a]\;\;$ and $("bc"\; (flip\,(:)))$ has type $Char
\rightarrow [Char]$ and $\;\;(flip\, (:)\; `z`)\;$ has type
$[Char]\rightarrow[Char]$.

\subsection{Patterns of recursion and {\it{foldr}}}

In class we presented the following two functions defined by recursion on the
structure of their list arguments:

\begin{program**}
\> sum' [] = 0\\
\> sum' (x:xs) = x + sum' xs\\
\> \\
\> prod' [] = 1\\
\> prod' (x:xs) = x * prod' xs\\
\end{program**}

We noted that these functions look pretty much the same -- they only differ in
their names, the identity element used (call it {\em{id}}) and the operator
(call it {\it{op}}) -- then they have the following shared form:

\begin{program**}
\> name [] = id\\
\> name (x:xs) = x `op` name xs\\
\end{program**}

By abstracting {\it{id}} and {\it{op}} we implemented a function (called
{\it{foldr}} that captures this pattern of recursion as follows:

\begin{program**}
\> foldr :: (a $\rightarrow$ b $\rightarrow$ b) $\rightarrow$ b $\rightarrow$ [a] $\rightarrow$ b\\
\> foldr op id [] = id\\
\> foldr op id (x:xs) = x `op` foldr op id xs\\
\end{program**}

We can then reimplement the {\it{sum'}} and {\it{prod'}} functions as follows:

\begin{program**}
\> sum' = foldr (+) 0  \\
\> prod' = foldr (*) 1\\
\end{program**}

It was noted in class that the following identity holds:

\begin{theorem}[]
$\forall{} xs : [a].\;\; {\mathit{foldr}} (:) [] \;\;=\;\; (\backslash{}x \rightarrow{}x)$
\end{theorem}

We will provide the means to prove theorems like this one which require a form
of induction next week.

\subsection{{\it{map}} and {\it{filter}}}


We defined the {\it{map}} function as follows:

\begin{program**}
\> map :: (a $\rightarrow$ b) $\rightarrow$ [a] $\rightarrow$ [b]\\
\> map f [] = [] \\
\> map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs\\
\end{program**}

The {\it{map}} function is higher order (its first argument is a function of
type $a \rightarrow{}b$).  If the list is empty it returns the empty list and
if not it decomposes the list and builds a new one whose head is obtained by
applying the function $f$ to the head of the input list and consing that onto
the result of recursively calling {\it{map f}} on the tail of the list.

The function {\it{filter}} takes a predicate (a function of type
$a\rightarrow{}Bool$ and a list (say $xs$) of type $[a]$ and returns a new list
containing only those elements of $xs$ which satisfy the predicate $p$
{\em{i.e.}} it keeps the elements $x$ in $xs$ for which $p\;x == True$.

\begin{program**}
\> filter':: (a $\rightarrow$ Bool) $\rightarrow$ [a] $\rightarrow$ [a]\\
\> filter' p [] = [] \\
\> filter' p (x:xs) = if p x then (x : filter' p xs) else filter' p xs
\end{program**}

\section{Problems}

\begin{problem}
Write a recursive function that behaves something like {\it{filter'}} but which
returns two lists:
\begin{program**}
\> partition :: (a $\rightarrow$ Bool) $\rightarrow$ [a] $\rightarrow$ ([a],[a])\\
\end{program**}
If {\it{partition p xs == (ys,zs)}} then the first list $ys$ should contain
those elements of $xs$ for which $p$ is {\it{False}} and the $zs$ should
contain those elements of $xs$ for which $p$ is {\it{True}}. warning: if you
copy code form the web -- be careful.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Rewrite {\it{map'}}, {\it{filter'}} and {\it{partition'}} using {\it{foldr}}
(and thereby not directly using recursion.)  Hint: This is tricky but a careful
reading of Chapter 6 of LYAHFGG should make it doable.
\end{problem}

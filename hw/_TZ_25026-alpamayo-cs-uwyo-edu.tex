We have been discussing the type classes Functor, Applicative and Monoid.  You can read about Foldable in Chapter 11 of LYAHFGG.

In this assignment you must instantiate a tree datatype as an instance
of the Functor type class and as an instance of the Applicative type
class.  Mapping over a tree is straightforward so the instantiation of
Tree as an instance of Functor is easy.  Your implementation of Tree
as an instance of the Applicative type class should be more like the
ZipList instantiation than the standard one for lists. In other words,
for the <*> operaotr of type {\it{Tree (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b}}

module Tree where

import Data.Functor
import Control.Applicative
import qualified Data.Foldable  as F
import Data.Monoid


data Tree a = Leaf | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a)  deriving (Eq,Show)

mktree [] = Leaf
mktree xs = Node (mktree ls) r (mktree rs)
  where (ls,r:rs) = splitAt (length xs `div` 2) xs

-- instance Functor Tree where
  -- fill this in


-- instance Applicative Tree where
--   pure x = 
--   Leaf <*> _ = 
--   (Node l f r) <*> Leaf = 
--   (Node l f r) <*> (Node l1 x r1)  = 


-- the following implementation if rigth out of LYAHFGG

instance F.Foldable Tree where
  foldMap f Leaf = mempty
  foldMap f (Node l x r) =  F.foldMap f l `mappend` f x `mappend` F.foldMap f r

flatten :: Tree a -> [a]
flatten = F.foldr (\x xs -> x:xs) []

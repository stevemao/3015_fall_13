In class we started to present the unification algorithm.  I have
provided an implementation and some tests (in comments at the end.)
Your assignment is to extend the code by adding a product type
constructor to the datatype {\tt{Type}} and then to extend the rest of
the functions to handle this new type.  Note that this include all
functions that do pattern matching on the type constructors for
datatype {\tt{Type}}.

Recall:

\begin{definition}
Type terms $t_1$ and $t_2$ are {\em{unifiable}} if there is a substitution
$\sigma$ such that $\sigma t_1 = \sigma t_2$.
\end{definition}

Thus, a unifier is a substitution that makes the terms equal.  

The algorithm is specified as follows:

\begin{description}
\item{i.)} A variable (say $x$) unifies with any term (say $t$) as long as $x\not\in{} FV(t)$.
\item{ii.)} If terms $t_1$ and $t_2$ are not variables, they unify if
  they have the same constructor, and if their subterms unify.
\end{description}

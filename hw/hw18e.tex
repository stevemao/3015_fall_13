\exercise{Read Chapter 11 of LYAHFGG.}  

\exercise{Instantiate the following two data-types as instances of the Functor type class.



\begin{program**}
\> \\
\> data T a = C a $\mid$ D a a  $\mid$ E [a] deriving (Eq,Show) \\
\>  \\
\> data Rose a = Rose a [Rose a] deriving (Eq,Show)\\
\> \\
\end{program**}

\noindent{}Remember that {\it{fmap}} is defined for lists.  I have provided a
few test cases. You can find more about Rose trees in the Bird text -- look in
the index to find the appropriate pages.
}

\exercise[Extra credit]{Prove that you instantiations of the Functor type class obey the Functor laws.}

In class we gave the following sorting code.

\begin{program*}
\> qsort [] = [] \\
\> qsort (h:hs) = qsort smaller ++ [h] ++ qsort larger \\
\>  where                                              \\
\>     smaller = [a | a <- hs, a < h]                  \\
\>     larger = [b | b <- hs, b >= h]                  \\
\end{program*}

The notation {\tt{[ b | b <- hs, b >= h]}} is called a list comprehension. As
described in class, the expression {\tt{b <- hs}} says, iterate over the
elements of the list {\tt{hs}} and collect together into a list all the
{\tt{b}}'s where {\tt{b >= h}}.

Once loaded into HUGS, checking the type gives the following result. 
\begin{program*}
\> > :t qsort                   \\
\> qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] \\
\>
\end{program*}

I suggested the following change to modify the type.
\begin{program*}
\> qsort [] = [] \\
\> qsort' (h:hs) = qsort' smaller ++ [h] ++ qsort' larger \\
\>  where                                              \\
\>     smaller = [a + 1 | a <- hs, a < h]                  \\
\>     larger = [b + 1 | b <- hs, b >= h]                  \\
\end{program*}

In fact, it does have the type that I suggested.

\begin{program*}
\> > :t qsort'                                \\
\> qsort' :: (Ord a, Num a) => [a] -> [a]   \\
\end{program*}

But this program does not have the behavior I suggested.  Here is the behavior it has.

\begin{program*}
\> Main> qsort' (reverse [1..10]) \\
\> qsort' (reverse [1..10]) \\
\> [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10] \\
\> Main> qsort' [1..10] \\
\> qsort' [1..10] \\
\> [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19] \\
\> Main> qsort' [1,10,9,2,8,3,7,4,6,5] \\
\> qsort' [1,10,9,2,8,3,7,4,6,5] \\
\> [1,5,8,11,14,14,13,12,11,11] \\
\> Main> qsort' [10,1,9,2,8,3,7,4,6,5] \\
\> [2,5,8,11,14,14,13,12,11,10] \\
Main> 
\end{program*}

What's happening here?  How can the program be fixed to give the answer?
Here's test cases and expected results for the program I thought I was writing.

\begin{program*}
\> Main>:t qsort1 \\
\> qsort1 :: (Num a, Ord a) => [a] -> [a] \\
\> Main> qsort1 (reverse [1..10]) \\
\> qsort1 (reverse [1..10]) \\
\> [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] \\
\> Main> qsort1 [1..10] \\
\> qsort1 [1..10] \\
\> [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] \\
\> Main> qsort1 [1,10,9,2,8,3,7,4,6,5] \\
\> qsort1 [1,10,9,2,8,3,7,4,6,5] \\
\> [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] \\
\> Main> qsort1 [10,1,9,2,8,3,7,4,6,5] \\
\> qsort1 [10,1,9,2,8,3,7,4,6,5] \\
\> [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] \\
\end{program*}

\noindent{}Your assignment is to:
\begin{description}
\item[1.)] Explain the behavior of {\tt{qsort'}}.
\item[2.)] Modify {\tt{qsort'}} creating a function {\tt{qsort1}} that
behaves properly.
\item[3.)] To run the tests to show your function behaves as expected.
